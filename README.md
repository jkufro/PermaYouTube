## Perma YouTube Chrome Extension ##

This project's goal is to give a similar video viewing window that the YouTube phone app provides when browsing other YouTube content. When the user is on a video the viewer is hidden, but when they leave a video page the viewer appears and starts playing their last video. It uses chrome storage to store data such as the video id, video time, paused state, the last x and y position of the viewer, and the viewer's size.

The viewer has the ability to be minimized, closed, and resized. All of these attributes are peristent with the use of chrome storage.
